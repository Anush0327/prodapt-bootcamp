1. Create a new repository on github.
2. Add a readme.md file. Add only your own name to it. Commit & push it.
3. Add your teammates to the github repository.
4. Instruct them to clone the repo, edit readme.md, add their name, save, commit, & push.
5. Debug issues publicly so others may learn from it!
6. Do step 2 and 4 **on the command line only**
